âš¾ MLB Strikeout Predictor
A machine learning project that predicts how many strikeouts a pitcher will record in a game.
## What it does
Uses Statcast data + team batting stats from pybaseball.
Builds rolling pitcher form (last 5â€“10 starts) and opponent K% trends.
Trains a Random Forest to predict per-game strikeouts.
Predicts Ks for upcoming games using probable pitchers.
## Results (Work in Progress)
Baseline (league avg): ~1.5 MAE
Random Forest: ~0.9 MAE, RÂ² ~0.6

## Why I built it
I love baseball and wanted to apply ML + data engineering to a real sports problem. I had alot of fun on this project and it helped me hone my skills in data collection, feature engineering, modeling, and producing usable predictions.
